# CANopen

The **CANopen** pane configures a node: the *PDO configuration* tab shows
every TPDO and RPDO with its COB-ID, transmission type, inhibit time, event
timer and mapped objects; edit a cell or map/unmap objects and *Write to node*
writes the communication and mapping records back over SDO.  The *Live PDOs* tab shows each
PDO with its receive count and rate, and the *Emergencies* tab decodes EMCY
objects: the CiA 301 error code, the error register bit by bit, and the five
manufacturer-specific bytes as decoded by
[`hooks/canopen.py::emcy_manufacturer`](hooks.md) (only the device maker knows what those
mean, so that is a hook).  The **SYNC producer** transmits sync
messages so synchronous PDOs are exchanged, **Store** / **Restore
defaults** are objects 0x1010 / 0x1011, and **Save DCF** reads every parameter
from the node into a `.dcf` file while **Apply DCF** writes a `.dcf` back into a
node -- so a device can be commissioned, captured and cloned.  What is *different* between two of them is the [Compare](compare.md) pane.

A node that stops sending heartbeats is marked **lost** in the node list and
reported in the Event Log; the timeout follows the producer time from object
0x1017, or the interval actually observed on the bus.  The *LSS* tab
commissions a device that has no node-ID yet (CiA 305): *Fastscan* discovers an
unconfigured node's identity, *Select by address* addresses a known one, then
set its node-ID and bit rate, store, and return to the waiting state.
