# pycangui

A user-friendly CAN bus tool: live trace, transmit, CANopen, UDS, J1939, XCP
and Python scripting, on any adapter supported by python-can.  Apache-2.0.

## Development

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -e .[dev,j1939,uds,xcp]
.venv\Scripts\python -m pycangui
```

Without hardware: pick interface `virtual`, channel `vcan0`, press Connect,
then enable Tools > Demo CANopen device.  A simulated node 5 appears in the
CANopen pane: its EDS is matched automatically, the object dictionary can be
read (double-click) and written (edit the value), NMT Start makes it transmit
TPDO1, and writing *Speed demand* (0x2001) moves the motor speed in the PDO.

## Customising

Everything in `%APPDATA%\pycangui` is yours: `hooks/*.py` hold small Python
functions pycangui calls at decision points (which EDS to use for a node, how
to name it, ...) with the defaults and commented examples in place; `eds/` is
scanned for EDS files matching a node's vendor/product; `settings.json` holds
what the GUI remembers.  Tools > Reload hooks applies edits without a restart.
